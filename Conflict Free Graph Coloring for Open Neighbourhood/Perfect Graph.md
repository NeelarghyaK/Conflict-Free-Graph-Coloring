"In graph theory, a perfect graph is a graph in which the chromatic number equals the size of the maximum clique, both in the graph itself and in every induced subgraph. In all graphs, the chromatic number is greater than or equal to the size of the maximum clique, but they can be far apart. The perfect graph theorem states that the complement graph of a perfect graph is also perfect. The strong perfect graph theorem characterizes the perfect graphs in terms of certain forbidden induced subgraphs, leading to a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph is perfect."- Wikipedia

1. Chain of rings formed by connecting one ring to another such that each vertex is shared by at most 2 rings, and 2 rings share at most 1 edge: Perfect graph as well as outer planar 
2. Rings connected
