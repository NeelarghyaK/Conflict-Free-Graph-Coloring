1. Forest : Xcfon=2
2. Rings(cyclic chain) : Xcfon=2 for even length, Xcfon=3 for odd length
3. When an acyclic chain is add with rings having odd length will reduce the Xcfon from 3 to 2 
4. Complete Bipartite Graph: Xcfon=2
5. Edges that are not part of any ring do not increase the Xcfon when added to an existing graph having Xcfon>1 [We can therefore remove all such edges to find an upper bound of the original graph]
7. Chain of rings formed by connecting one ring to another such that each vertex is shared by atmost 2 rings, and 2 rings shares atmost 1 edge : Xcfon<=3
8. If 2 rings shares more than 1 edge then the structure becomes outerplanar since it contains K(2,3) minor
9. Windmill graph: Graphs that have multiple rings sharing a single vertex but do not share any edges. Xcfon<=3 
10. If color of two vertices are fixed and there is a acyclic chain(n>1) then it can be 3 colorable.
11. Whenever there is a 3 membered ring color all of them different. [Except in windmill graph]
12. Spiral Graph: Graphs that have multiple rings and shares a single vertex and 2 adjacent rings shares an edge.
